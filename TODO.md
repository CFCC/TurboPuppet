To Do
=====

Scratchpad for random ideas of things that need done.

* Drivers
* Verify RDP enable
* Linux repos
* Whole buncha stuff for profile::cfcc::camper
Charlie's $0.02

* jdk8 > jdk10
* remove eclipse
* add a good text editor (I use notepad2-mod; I think lots of the others are overkill and overwhelming, nbd though)
* Add registry entry to allow edit of any file from context menu in classesroot/*/editinnotepad[Edit in Notepad]/command/notepad.exe %1
* add python 2.7? I recall we use odd python stuff that has compatibility issues and thought that might be one; I'm okay leaving it out if it's not an issue
* We still do alice? is it update?
* Any way to pre-configure SDKs in PyCharm and IDEA?
* Add games? Especially one with a hacked up q3 config
* Add Chrome, Firefox with homepage set to computercampwiki.com and prelogged in as camper
