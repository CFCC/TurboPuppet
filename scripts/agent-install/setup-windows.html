        It's amazing this file is needed. Edge in 1803 doesn't
        let you download ps1 (or apparently, exe) files directly.
        It forces you to save them as .txt, and because Explorer
        doesn't automatically show extensions it's a pain-in-the-ass
        to change. But if you Rclick and save, then it works. GAH!
